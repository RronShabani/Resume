## Technical

### Indie Game Dev | Sept 2020 - ongoing
Personal side project with a team consisting of me and an artist. Designing and developing games with the Godot engine. Most relevant general use skills learned so far have been Programming Patterns and code organization.

### Backend Developer | Jul-Sept 2020 (3 mo.)
Designed and developed the backend for two REST mobile apps - business and client - and communication between them, using Java and Spring. Implemented payments on the server side with Stripe.

### IT Support at a dental clinic | on-call since ca. 2012
Maintained software and hardware. Built PCs when new systems were needed. Helped train staff (non-tech) how to use the software. Created routines for organization and storage of files.

### Co-contracted Network Installation | summer 2015
Re-installed (from scratch) the network for an internet cafe / gaming center with 100+ PCs. Personally mainly involved with the physical installation of cables and switches. Main difficulty was that the place remained open 24/7 so we had to be as non disruptive as possible.

## Non-Technical

### Member of the student reprezentation in the dormitory | Volunteering | 2018 - 2019 (~1.5 years)
Organized weekly parties in the dorm bar / party room (incl. bartending, cleaning etc.).

Also did projects such as buying utensils for the public dorm kitchens etc.

### Summer Camp Counselor - YMLP2019 | Volunteering | summer 2019
Counselor (Leader) for a group of 6 high school students at YMLP - a leadership summer camp - organized with the help of Peace Corps (50%+ staff) and funding from U.S. Ambassy. In charge of everything regarding the team but main duties involve keeping everybody in time, safe and behaving correctly as well as boosting morale. Helping them overcome homesickness, no access to phones, camp conditions etc.
